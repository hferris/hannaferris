        <h1>Hanna Ferris</h1> 

            <p>
                Welcome to my digital portfolio, my name is Hanna Ferris. I graduated from the University of Dubuque with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing and Communication Minor. 
                I am currently working to get a Web Development Certificate by taking on a full-stack coding program, through Trilogy at the University of Arizona with an expected graduation date of May 10, 2021. 
                Upon graduation, I want to be able to incorporate my marketing degree with the certificate to land a career in the IT industry. 
                My goal is to become a Business Analyst or Quality Assurance Specialist in a company, where Iâ€™ll be able to utilize my background in marketing and my talents in Web Development to strengthen business requirements within IT.
